# Use cases for openDS 

This document describes some of the use cases foreseen as driving the specification work on openDS.

They are organised into those of interest from the point of view of being enabling for new modes of work and those more directly relevant to persons that will use specimens for science.

*This is what I've done initially - but the allocation of specific use cases to each of the two main categories is not yet correct. <span style="color:red">Needs changing.</span>*

## Use cases enabling for new modes of work

In this category we are thinking of the cases 1 - 4 shown in the following illustration.* 

![illustration of technical cases](/images/technical-cases.png)

### Use case T1: Transfer Digital Specimen data from one system to another

On request, one system (computer, software) transfers Digital Specimen data to another system (computer, software). Either across a network or within the same machine. 

### Use case T2: Allow operations to act on Digital Specimen remotely 

Machines or machine agents acting on behalf of humans can perform designated operations on a Digital Specimen located on a remote machine across a network.

### Use case T3: Package one or more Digital Specimens for preservation/download

Digital Speciment data (or a subset of it) can be packaged for preservation or download.

### Use case T4: Guide (but not constrain) the internal design of systems

The internal design of a system is guided by but not constrained by the specification of openDS and its requirements e.g., for object model, compliance, etc.

## Use cases for science

### Use case S1: Finding/accessing more information about specimens

open Digital Specimens provide opportunities for accessing more information about or related to natural science specimens (preserved plants, animals, fossils, rocks, minerals, etc.) with easier access leading to better workflows and better research. As a curated and authoritative digital twin for the physical specimen, a Digital Specimen with its package of links to other data could be a considerably more reliable and efficient information source than crawling potential databases manually for information about and derived from the physical specimen.

### Use case S2: Easier consumption/use of data and improved curation

Higher degrees of standardization, as epitomized by the openDS specification make it easier to consume and use data and improve curation. But such standardization but must accommodate multiple scenarios (e.g., preserved specimens, living specimens, jars of specimens, splitting of specimens, cases where there is no specimen but other objects like photos, illustrations, recordings, etc., and cases where the original specimen has been lost or destroyed). Not everything needs to be standardized but to benefit, you need something more standard for additional (supplementary) content.

### Use case S3: Support transformation of working practices

e.g., in moves towards more community-oriented curatorial practices for data about and derived from specimens.

*To be further elaborated.*

### Use case S4: Linking information from/to other (sub-)disciplines

Linking information makes taxonomic work easier and enables linkage of data and information from and to other disciplines. Community curation saves a lot of effort in making these links compared to the case where every collection must make all the (semantic) links on their own.

### Use case S5: Facilitate tracking of specimen use

Persistently identified open Digital Specimens in conjunction with third-party services can facilitate tracking of specimen use e.g., when mentioned in publications by means of its persistent identifier.

### Use case S6: Crediting work performed
Work performed in relation to a specimen, including gathering in the first place or deriving new data/information through analysis can be unambiguously attributed to the correct person(s) e.g., in conjunction with a researcher's ORCID iD. This can  provide incentives to create open Digital Specimens in the first place.

### Use case S7: Align specimen concepts and provide strong foundation across institutions

Digital Specimens can help to align specimen concepts and specimen metadata structure across institutions, as well as providing a strong foundation for attaching annotations/interpretations and records of loans and visits.

### Use case S8: A single virtual collection and many thematic collections

Handling specimens openly on the Internet offers opportunities for establishing a single virtual collection across multiple participating institutions (such as the European Collection Objects Index to be established by the DiSSCo research infrastructure) as well as the possibility to curate Digital Specimens in multiple thematic collections simultaneously - for example all specimens collected in Charles Darwin's HMS Beagle voyages. The latter is not easily achievable for physical objects.

### Use case S9: Assess data suitability and/or reliability
Provenance data supplied with an open Digital Specimen can help to assess suitability and/or reliability of data for specific purposes. Available metadata can inform about possible usage restrictions and/or obligations associated with use (licenses, Nagoya protocol, etc.).

### Use case S10: Notification of change

Bringing changes in content to notice of researchers, educators and others without the need for them to actively look for that. A subscribe/notify capability (i.e., subscribe to a specimen of interest and be notified that its content has changed or that itâ€™s been used in some way).
